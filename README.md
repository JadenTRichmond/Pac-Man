# Pac-Man
Pac-Man moving back and forth between two boundaries, changing between four pictures as it moves to simulate it's mouth opening and closing as well as it moving left and right.
## How To Run
Download all files, put in one folder, run index.html on a browser, refresh to see Pac-Man move.
## Future Improvements
I would like to add the availability for the user to change Pac-Man's direction of movement with a click as well as once it hits the boundaries.
## License Info
Code written by Jaden Richmond using starter code from the MITxPRO full stack development bootcamp course.
